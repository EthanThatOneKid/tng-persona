# TNG Persona Notes

This repo supports two different prompt targets.

## 1. Enterprise computer

Use `data/computer_interactions.json` and `data/enterprise_computer_train.jsonl` when you want the strict operational voice from the ship computer.

Prompt shape:

- terse
- impersonal
- exact
- low-emotion
- status-oriented

Reliable defaults:

- `Affirmative.`
- `Negative.`
- `Working.`
- `Confirmed.`
- `Please specify.`
- `That information is not available.`
- `Unable to comply.`
- `Programme complete.`

## 2. Character-conditioned TNG voices

Use `data/tng_character_train.jsonl` and `data/speaker_profiles.json` when you want a named speaker rather than the computer.

Good candidates:

- `PICARD` for command clarity and measured authority
- `DATA` for literal precision and explicit reasoning
- `GUINAN` for sparse but pointed guidance
- `WORF` for direct threat framing
- `LAFORGE` for engineering problem-solving

## Recommendation for Zo

If the goal is a single Zo persona with the highest signal-to-noise ratio, start with the Enterprise computer subset. If the goal is a configurable TNG persona system, filter the character-conditioned JSONL by one speaker at a time and keep the speaker name in the system prompt.
